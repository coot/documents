# IndieHosters, hosting for freedom, not for profit

## Communication

### Activities

Our goal is to provide hosting service for free, and as easy as possible to people with minimum knowledge.

### Business Model

Donation based. If we reach 15k users, then it would cost 1â‚¬/user/year. So we could work donation based

### Number of employees

2  at the beginning, and then organic grow. All procedures are open,  so if you want to start your cell tomorrow, we help you doing that.

### Trends of activity sector

Growing concern of citizens, coming actors, so it is a growing sector

### Concurrents (not really opponent, but similar in the goal)
- www.sandstorm.io
- withknown.com
- wordpress.com, tumblr.com, blog/cms platforms
- traditional shared hosting companies like https://www.1and1.com/, dreamhost.com, gandi.net, ovh.com
- Gmail / Google apps

### Our strategy / Distinction from Concurrent

Our  decentralized system of multiple independent hosters and free software makes our organization more robust than e.g. tumblr or withknown

Our product is much easier to use than that of dreamhost or gandi

Compared to sandstorm, High-Availability would be built in.

Compared  to sandstorm/withknown: if sandstorm/idno is the software you want, then we may be able to host it cheaper. otherwise, we offer many other products as well.

Compared  to Google: we are small-scale, and aim for openness rather than profit.  It's a bit like buying your veg from a local bio farmer.

A  more personal relationship; talk to your server farmer on a first-name  basis, e.g. in tech support / billing / etc., just like a small shop in a  village

### Values

Ownership: you own your URL, your data, and your prepaid hosting credits, and can fire your host and hire a different one whenever you want to switch

Sustainable -> help to support open technology. Lots of decentralized protocols activated by default; you help them gain critical mass.

Small-scale -> each host is an autonomous unit, making for a robust organization, but also it's sort of trendy to be indie-style, exclusive, hand-picked, sympathetic and personal (e.g. tech support)

### Target

1. a geek (woman or man) aged between 15 and 40. She/He is probably working as software engineer and cares about free software and likes playing around/tinkering with computers.
2. anybody that is concerned by privacy, and ready to  give up a bit of usabilty and money in exchange of freedom. Could also be anti-capitalist / left-wing intellectual. probably buys Bio food.
3. people around the first target, as the first target is knowledgable to advice on the services to use ;) Person who simply wants to have an email address, a website to publish their  blogposts on, and a server to store some photo albums on. They could  have gone to Google Apps for this, but they find us more human and sympathetic. These are probably non-paying customers (maybe received an  invite from a paying friend), but we're nonetheless happy to have them, as long as we also have enough crowdfunders (target 1) and payers (target 2).

## Brainstorm (just for more background)

### Names
- Indiehost: the personal hosters
- personal hosters    (a bit like personal trainers! get  a personal hoster to run your    website. personalhosters.com is free and so is personalhoster.com.  also   sounds like a thing you need! and less boring than indiehosters,  in a   way)
- thirdpartypeople (works when mentioned on e.g. owncloud.org/providers but not so clear that it's got anything to do with web/internet)
- indiehost     (immediately clear what it does, but maybe suggests that it's part  of    the indie phone / indie tech project; especially confusing if  they    crowdfund also in November)
- indiehosters (indiehosters.com is free), indieadmins - sounds a bit boring
- indie service providers/Indie server providers/IndieNet: Server providers.
- websteading/websteaders (this is too personal server then, and the image of seasteading.. Opposite to our values)
- sustainable web/sustainable hosters (but this is a term already used for web hosting with green energy)
- occupy the web
